Killer Minecraft
======

This is a Bukkit server plugin that offers a new game mode based around suspicion and paranoia, to be played on a brand new world.

The game is best played on Hard difficulty (3), and in a manner similar to Hardcore mode, when you die, you're out until the end of the round.

After the first day of play, one player will be informed that they are the Killer. No one else will know who it is. The other players have to bring a blaze rod or ghast tear to a tower near the spawn, and the killer has to stop them.

Significant features include:

* Once you die, you become an invisible spectator, and can fly and use "follow" mode - type /spec to list spectator commands.

* Easy to use voting system, lets players vote on if & how to restart the game, and more - type /vote to bring up the vote menu.

* Rebuilds new worlds without having to kick players, by moving them to a temporary "holding" world first.

* Death messages no longer say who killed the victim. This makes it possible for the killer to pick people off one by one if they don't stick together.

* If the killer has a compass, it will point towards the nearest player. This helps them find other players if they all scatter in different directions.

* The killer will be given some items to help them. These won't be significant if playing against only a few players, but if there are a large number, the killer can get some very useful items.

* At dawn every day, if there isn't a (surviving) killer assigned, and there are sufficient players, a new killer will be assigned. Every time a killer is assigned, all players are told about it - they're just not told who it is.

Killer Minecraft works best with 4-8 players, although the bare minimum is 3 players, and there is no maximum limit. You should start play on a new world, and shouldn't play on any world containing anything you wish to keep - the world can be deleted at the end of a round! Lastly, remember that in hard mode, you can starve to death. Players should get aim to get some food as soon as possible.
