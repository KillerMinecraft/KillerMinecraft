Killer
======

A Bukkit server plugin for MineCraft that assigns one player as "the killer," without telling anyone else who it is.


Currently, everything has to be done manually, using op commands. This isn't a major hassle, and if you're all physically in the one location, you can emulate this by each drawing a bit of paper out of a hat, with one bit having "killer" written on it.

Recommended play:

* Until dawn on the second day, all players play cooperatively. We recommend playing on "hard" difficulty.

* At dawn on the second day, an op runs the following command: /killer assign
  This assigns one player to be the killer, but doesn't tell anyone else who. The op doesn't get told either!
  
* The remaining players must attempt to retrieve either a blaze rod or a ghast tear, and bring it back to their spawn.

* The "killer" must stop them by any means possible!

* If the item is retrieved successfully, the "normal" players win. If they die, the killer wins. If they are otherwise
  incapable of retrieving it, or it reaches a pre-arranged "end time", then the game is drawn.

* Ops may use the /killer reveal command at the end of the game, to tell everyone who the killer was, if this isn't obvious.
