Killer Minecraft
======

This is a Bukkit server plugin that allows you to play a variety of PVP games on "temporary" worlds, either alongside the existing worlds on your server, or as the only thing on the server.

It comes with a variety of game modes and world generation options, and makes it very easy to add new ones, as each of these are separate plugins, dependent on this one.

When the server's default world is set to "killer", players will start in the staging world, which allows you (through buttons) to configure the game you want to play. When a game is in progress, new players will join that game directly.

When the server's default world is NOT set to "killer", players can type /killer join to enter the staging world, or the current game if there is one.
They can then play as normal, or type /killer quit to leave Killer at any time. For players that forget this command, there is also an "exit" button in the staging world.

For players that are waiting around for other players to join the server, the staging world features a spleef arena that doubles as a monster arena, allowing you to fight off waves of monsters.

Killer Minecraft features many features designed to prevent each game mode from having to reinvent the same things over and over again. It features a comprehensive spectator mode for dead players, world protection, team chat, voting, and much more.

Most of the game modes that come with Killer Minecraft focus more on subterfuge and misdirection, as opposed to straight up deathmatch. For more information on each, please see the game modes page:

Happy killing!
